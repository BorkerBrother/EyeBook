# Eye Tracking



## Getting started


## IDEAS
- Eye Tracking erkennt welches Kapitel und ändert den Hintergrund und Atmosphäre 
  - > Kapitel könnte beim Lesen übersprungen werden, also lieber nach Header für Kapitel suchen lassen um 
  die nun gebrauchte sound-bibliothek zu preloaden

- Website mit beispielen (Kann von allen Geräten aufgerufen werden)
  - Geräterkennung
      - > Resolution, screen size and camera position
      - > Make use of cookiez
      - > If no camera is available send error    
  -  Website has to be dynamic: CSS a must
  -  ask for camera access from user

    
- Boxes in Text to interact with eyes and start sound after reading 1 Second
 - > we could make the Programm look for spaces. So we let it hold right click and when there is a space, copy the Word 
   > analyse if it is alone or in combination with previous words a Databank trigger 
- Databank with sounds, fitting the book required
  - > Use  Universal Keywords with Book shortcut as Dataname to eas management and usage

- Maybe there is a way to make it work with Pdf's or other file's too, a .exe might work on Windows, an app might actually
be smarter to access a broader audience espacially on IOs
  - > an integration with other apps like the reader app from apple or Amazons book app might be worth

# For Developement
- 
- FACE MESH MEDIA PIPE
  - > Maybe we work directly with Facemesh and reduce some landmarks: reduce data, memory, costs
    > Maybe we can make more landmarks in the Iris section for better reaction with the eyes
    > Machine Learning with recorded Video content from a user reading ebook´s
    > Testing with diffeerent Webcams and Mobile Devices


- The split between learning stuff might be smart
  - > eg. One goes more into Frontend, and one deeply into backend, while not letting the other one be completly clueless
    >
